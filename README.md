# VizAthon
### First Place Winner

Two fellow team members and I participated in the 2021 Vizathon: Disrupting Childhood Obesity, presented by the Data Intensive Studies Center at Tufts (DISC) and ChildObestiy180. 

My team designed an Tableau Dashboard that visualizes childhood obesity risk factors in Milwaukee, WI. 
We utilized ArcGIS for data collection, Python for statistical normalization and standardization, and Tableau to create our interactive dashboard.
